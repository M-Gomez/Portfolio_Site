  "ACText": "This is an app created for Resendiz AC & Heating, a local HVAC provider servicing both residential and commercial installs. The app was created in order to streamline their process for assigning, scheduling, and documenting services. The application is a Flutter based multiplatform mobile app that adapts its UI to allow both Managers and Employees to access the same app to perform their duties. This includes a secure system for adding, changing, and deleting employee credentials, with a tiered permission system allowing owners to override managers. The application also allows the upload and display of notes and images so that work orders can be properly documented, and dated. The application communicates with a SQL Server for authentication and retrieval of records.",
  "LancePartyText": "Lance Party is a local multiplayer \"Arena Battler Party Game\" with over 10 playable classes, 8 maps, and dozens of game modifiers and modes. The gameplay loop consists of repeating rounds of battle between the up to 4 participating players. Each round they gain gold which can be used to purchase gear to increase their stats, new spells, or upgrades to augment their existing spells. Each round a random game mode and game modifer are selected as well as a random map. This keeps gameplay chaotic, and ensures that players are always on their toes. The map designs are each different, and each has its own unique mechanics or stage hazards. Currently in development using C# and the Unity Game Engine. ",
  "FXAppText": "This application displays a library of books and allows users to create, read, update, and delete entries. It includes a corresponding Java Rest server and API used for both authentication and accessing/mutating records, and a simple application for generating massive amounts of unique mock records and inserting them into the database.",
  "Web3Text": "Web3 Welcome Page was an Ethereum based Web3 project based upon the idea of collectivist art and interactive artistic expression. The concept was that minted tokens would serve as proof of ownership over specific pixels in the shared canvas, and could be recolored, traded, rented, or sold to other users. Although the project never officially launched and is now essentially defunct, the Flutter/Dart based front end web application portion of the project which I was in charge of was largely finished, and largely feature complete.",
